== Technical overview

This solution pattern builds on top an event-driven architecture in order to support the extension of the legacy stack. The architecture includes new microservices, event streaming, event processing and search indexing tools.

In respect to the xref:_story_goals[story goals] and xref:use-cases[targeted use cases], it's recommended to consider adopting an https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/[Enterprise Integration Pattern] for data integration, more specifically, adopting the https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-change-data-capture[Change Data Capture (CDC)] pattern.

This solution requires *no source code changes* in the existing services. The core concept builds on data integration between legacy and new services through usage of asynchronous events. A short description of this solution key concept is:

****
Relevant changes to data persisted in the tracked databases (e.g. delete/insert/update) are captured and published as events. Then, external services react to events and execute necessary operations.
****

The integration happens like this:

1. Using https://debezium.io/[Debezium], the database becomes an event stream. Since data changes are directly tracked, the legacy application code won't require changes.
2. The captured data changes are pushed to topics in a https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-apache-kafka[Kafka] broker.
3. The services that offers that extra capabilities can then subscribe to relevant topics and use the events to obtain the information needed to execute its logic.
