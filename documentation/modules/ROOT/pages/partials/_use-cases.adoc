== Use cases

Common use cases that can be addressed with this architecture are:

- Legacy services need to be extended or enhanced but, it is *not* a possibility to implement the changes in the existing application;
- New applications or services must leverage existing data from an existing stack of services;
- The organization seeks to move towards cloud environments and comply to best practices on cloud-native architectures but must also guarantee that any production-active legacy system data is also synchronized to the new services;
- The organization seeks to move towards cloud environments and comply to best practices on cloud-native architectures but must also guarantee that any production-active legacy system data is also synchronized to the new services;
- Legacy applications are now extended and complemented by capabilities delivered by new microservices or services (e.g. search index, cache) but the data should always be synchronized.
